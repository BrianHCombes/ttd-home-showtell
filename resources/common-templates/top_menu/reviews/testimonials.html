            First off i just wanted to mention that i had a chance to try your product a few weeks ago, and all I can 
            say is WOW!! A truly amazing product...simple design, easy to use and it really works!!  These flawlessly 
            held a large heavy tarp up in pretty windy conditions with no issues. I guarantee we could not have kept 
            that tarp in place without your product!!

        <p class="testimonial"><b>Application: Boat Storage</b><br>
            Greetings,<br>
            Last fall after my 24’X30’ poly tarp got blown off my boat for the second time in less than a month I discovered 
            the EZ Grabbits. Not only have they done the job but yesterday we were battered by a massive windstorm. 
            Wind gusts in excess of 95 mph were recorded. My tarp remained securely in place. Thank you for a great product!

        <p class="testimonial"><b>Application: Camping</b><br>Hi, these EZ Grabbits are great. I like them a lot to make fast
            tarp shelters when I go camping. Thanks for such a great product and keep up the good service and work.

        <p class="testimonial"><b>Application: Unknown</b><br>Brian - Just wanted to say thanks for the extra pack of the 
            Grabbit Tarp Holder. We just love them – they work great – and now we’ll have a back up set. We got our first 
            pack at XXXXXXX XXXXXX – but when we went back, they were out and could not get any. So glad to have found your 
            website. And we’ll be sure to tell everyone about your great product.

        <p class="testimonial"><b>Application: Tarp Awning on end of Truck</b><br>Thank you... The second order is #XXXX. BTW 
            I have a set of these on the end of my truck camper to use as a tarp awning... Used the awning during very high 
            winds gusts and heavy rains in Denali.. Worked fantastic!... Using now one set to protect a car from the elements 
            during the winter will see how it works out.. Last year we had lots of snow and a recorded wind of 105mph.

        <p class="testimonial"><b>Application: Haystack</b><br> I just started using them this summer when I started to cover 
            a hay stack of small square bales. I have 3 heavy silver tarps tied together with them and have had no problem 
            holding them together. I use the large size for this. I have used the Ez Grabbit and really like the way it hold 
            tarps.  I have 3 20 x 30 ft. tarps covering an outdoor hay stack.  What we need now is a spike of some kind that 
            can be placed (drove if you will) into the end of a hay bale to tie the tarp to when held with the Grabbit. Not 
            sure if a insert and twist type item would be better than a straight in to hold it in place.  In either case it 
            would have to be removable as the hay is used/sold.  Tying to the twine on hay bales is not always a good way to 
            anchor the tarp.  It would need to be capable of being used on small squares as well as the large round bales. 
            Thank you for a great product.

        <p class="testimonial"><b>Application: Pool Cover</b><br>I have a very large in ground pool that I have to cover with 
            tarps (60’ X 40’ and 20’ X 40’) to keep dry. The pool is empty and I have a special epoxy paint that requires the 
            concrete to be perfectly dry before application. I have tried every possible way to cover my pool that allows air 
            to flow and to keep dirt, leaves, and rain out of my pool until temperatures and concrete conditions allow me to 
            paint. I have tied all the tarps down using their grommets only to have wind tear right through them. So far your 
            EZ Grabbits are working very well, although I have to get different stakes to anchor to because the wind is pulling 
            up the stakes. None of the EZ Grabbits have failed or tore through the tarps yet. I need more Grabbits to better 
            anchor the tarps for water runoff and security. I didn’t get the tarps fixed up until this past weekend (02-21-09). 
            I need them to hold until the temperatures in Virginia reach above 60 degrees. If I can keep rain out of my pool 
            then I will have several months for the concrete to dry enough to paint. Sorry for the long story, but my pool 
            has been out of commission since last April and I don’t want to go another summer without my pool. I can send 
            some pictures if you want.

        <p class="testimonial"><b>Application: Hunting Camp</b><br>Greetings. It was with some small degree of dismay that I 
            viewed your video clip about the construction of a lean-to shelter. We usually camp/hunt in the higher mountains 
            in BC and WA. It is not uncommon to have 4-8" of snow fall overnight. The video appears to show that the 'proper' 
            way to install these clips is to roll the tarp UP then place the clips on. This will certainly cause the snow to 
            be retained ON the roof, or horizontal surface, rather than encourage it to fall off. We will be ordering another 
            dozen or so of your EZ Grabbits for our next major hunt in the fall of 2006. The outfitters and park wardens that 
            have visited our camp in the past have been truly amazed at the simplicity of the shelter(s) and how complete they 
            are. The versatility of the tarps and clamps make this the ideal way to minimise the amount of weight and load to 
            pack in. Thanks so much.

        <p class="testimonial"><b>Application: Unknown</b><br>In fact, all I really need is a handfull of sleeves as I have 
            been using the grabbits for a number of years courtesey of my brother in Boulder. Unfortunately, good as they 
            are and they really do what it says on the box, some sleeves tend to get lost over the years!

        <p class="testimonial"><b>Application: Drag Tarp using Bag Grabbit</b><br>HI, Just bought your bag handle for the 
            missus. She was impressed, as was I, with the simplicity of which used to be an aggravating job of pulling the 
            tarp down to the burn pile.<br>June 4, 2008

        <p class="testimonial"><b>Application: Unknown</b><br>I'm not fussy about the colour, blue, red, yellow or green are 
            fine. I'd prefer not to have brown simply because brown is much harder to see on the forest floor if they come 
            apart. These are a great product and well designed!

        <p class="testimonial"><b>Application: Boat Storage</b><br>Rec'd my order and assumed you guys might like a little 
            feedback. Wrapped up my boat last week. Installation of Grabbitts as advertised. Could not be easier. Please pass 
            on my thanks to Brian for the extra units as I don't have his email address. Much appreciated. I will try to 
            remember to give you an update in the Spring when I uncover boat and Grabbitts have had the test of a New England 
            Winter with snow and northeast winds. From all I see I don't foresee any problems - looks like a great product.

        <p class="testimonial"><b>Application: Construction</b><br>The roof of our building is now covered with seven large 
            blue and metallicgray tarps which took about eight hours work, 70 EZ Grabbits tarp fasteners and 400 feet of 3/8" 
            rope to accomplish.  We have kept each story of the building covered with tarps as we've built up and throughout 
            the entire building process. Keeping things covered is getting more complex lately.  The EZ Grabbits are sometimes 
            used alone to overlap and join tarps together edge to edge.  The EZ Grabbits are screwed into wood framing along 
            the peaks and elsewhere to directly attach tarps, then many EZ Grabbits are attached to ropes to tie down tarp 
            edges all around the perimeter.  We love the EZ Grabbits, they are amazing and we couldn't keep the rain out 
            without them.  We ordered our metal roofing yesterday, and in two weeks the tarps will start coming down as we 
            install the roofing.

        <p class="testimonial"><b>Application: Deck Cover</b><br>Thanks for the update. While our California winters are milder 
            than other parts of the country, I've found your products to be extremely useful for high wind/rain situations around 
            my house. The long grabbits are even better than the small ones for holding down tarp laid on a deck. I used to get 
            the small ones locally at XXXX XXXXX, but they don't carry it anymore. They used to be displayed next to the tarps. 
            I've tried to get them to reorder, but they seem disinterested, even though they always sold out. In fact, the store 
            clerks blame the buyers. Thank goodness there's Google and the Internet.

        <p class="testimonial"><b>Application: Camping</b><br> I just spent five days in the wilderness where four of your EZ 
            Grabbit Tarp Tie Down  devices allowed us to connect a 10 x 12 tarp to a 10 x 14 tarp and not only survive a torrential 
            rainfall with 20 mph winds, but cook both a breakfast and dinner there while the rain was pouring down. I look forward 
            to the increased possibilities with the bulk quantity currently in shipment. I wish you continued success and encourage 
            you to continue to develop innovative products as you have been doing.

        <p class="testimonial"><b>Application: Haystack in New Zealand</b><br>I have a 5 bay barn 15m long with three of those bays 
            open for access. I have never got around to building the doors and now there is hay etc stacked in there I wanted to 
            protect it from the elements. We are in a high wind zone and the normal fixing of tarps usually saw them rip at the 
            eyelets. I purchased three new polytarps 3m x 3m and fixed the tops permanently to the beam across the opening. Down each 
            side of each tarp I have 3 grabbits on bunge cord. Over the last 24 hours we have had the worst winds yet since they have 
            been up and only one lowwer corner came loose. No sure why but an excellent result. At $10.00 NZ per tarp plus the grabbits, 
            it was a cheap door.

        <p class="testimonial"><b>Application: RV Cover</b><br>I use them for securing my RV cover after the built-in tie-downs tore 
            out in a strong wind.  So far, I have been very impressed with their performance.  I think you are really on the right 
            track with this product.  I am impressed with your ingenuity.

        <p class="testimonial"><b>Application: RV Cover</b><br>We have been selling the EZ- Grabbit tarp holders for some time now, 
            first as a FMA product and now as a corporately supplied SKU.   I was not totally convinced of their value until I used 
            them to help hold down a tarp on our own RV.  I was instantly addicted.  If our store paid someone to stand at the display 
            I believe it would pay for his or her salary twice over.  The video supplied with the product is the best way to sell them.  
            Without it people will just not understand their value.  I believe that the use of EZ Grabbits will spread like fire as more 
            and more people become addicted to the multiple uses.  
            I will never tie on a tarp the same way again!!!!!!!!<br><br><span style="font-style:italic; color:darkgreen;"> Note from
