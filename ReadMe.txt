    This project is all about preparing this Viewnav app for production as a 
    framework and content populating. Assuming all goes well, I'll be able to
    use the ViewNav app again and again for each product, for each issue, or
    for each bit of info as needed. It'll be about developer discretion. 

    It'll be reusable again and again and not just for TTD.

    I'll keep notes to a minimum and only log issues that will matter to
    future upgrades and improvements. The Viewnav app will be uploaded into
    a git repository when it's cleaned up enough and ready for use, 
    maintenence and upgrades. That should be within a few days.
