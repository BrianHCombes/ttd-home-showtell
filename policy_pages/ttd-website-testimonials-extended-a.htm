    <p class="testimonial" style="">Customer:<br>Greetings. It was with some small degree of dismay that 
        I viewed your video clip about the construction of a lean-to shelter. We usually camp/hunt in the higher 
        mountains in BC and WA. It is not uncommon to have 4-8" of snow fall overnight. The video appears to show 
        that the 'proper' way to install these clips is to roll the tarp UP then place the clips on. This will certainly 
        cause the snow to be retained ON the roof, or horizontal surface, rather than encourage it to fall off. We 
        will be ordering another dozen or so of your EZ Grabbits for our next major hunt in the fall of 2006. The 
        outfitters and park wardens that have visited our camp in the past have been truly amazed at the simplicity 
        of the shelter(s) and how complete they are. The versatility of the tarps and clamps make this the ideal 
        way to minimise the amount of weight and load to pack in. Thanks so much.

    <span style="font-style:italic; color:darkgreen;"><br><br>Response from Brian at Tarp Tie Down Company:<br>I 
        appreciate your feedback. Any tips, techniques, and applications from you that are better than what we 
        currently show are readily welcome.  Regarding your critique about "rolling up" the tarp to attach the 
        Grabbits, if I understand you correctly you are referring to wrapping the tarp around the Dog Bone and 
        sliding the Sleeve into place to complete the connection. <br><br>Given that here are my thoughts:<br>1) 
        There is not necessarily a "proper" way to apply or use the Grabbits. The only critical result is that 
        the Dog Bone and Sleeve are properly engaged once attached. Otherwise you can attach the Grabbits upside 
        down, inside out and which ever way as long as the two pieces engage properly.<br><br></span>

    Customer:<br> I stand by my original comment, that the video shows the tarp being rolled UP, instead of DOWN 
    in order to attach the Grabitt. It is not the fastener itself which causes the problem, it is the new profile 
    of the canvas, which reduces the tendancy for snow to 'shoot off'. 
     
    <span style="font-style:italic; color:darkgreen;"><br><br>Response from Brian at Tarp Tie Down Company:<br>2)
        As for an inadvertent snow catch being created, once the attachment is complete please note the only protrusion 
        from the plane of the tarp is a small bit of the Dog Bone and the rope itself. Essentially, the rope is the 
        only thing that really emanates from the plane of the tarp. This should minimize the snow catch problem.<br><br>
        Please pause the lean-to video at 39 secs or pause the covering a truck load video at 1min 21secs to see 
        the nature of the tarp area at the connection point.<br><br></span>

    Customer:<br>Greetings Brian, I truly appreciate the fact that you took the time to reply to me. Perhaps I 
    'overstated' the case when I used the words "small degree of dismay". I would suggest that we were quite possibly 
    looking at that comment from a different perspective. Obviously you were placing the emphasis on 'dismay', where 
    I meant that the emphasis be placed on 'small'. 

    <span style="font-style:italic; color:darkgreen;"><br><br>Response from Brian at Tarp Tie Down Company:<br>It's 
        good to hear you have been successful with your tarp and Grabbit shelter systems and that those around you 
        are impressed. With your permission, I would like to send you a couple of pictures of our campsite shelters. 
        If OK let me know.<br><br></span>

    Customer:<br>please do. Always good to compare notes.<br> By the way, I made a version of this product several 
    years ago from two different sizes of 'black plastic pipe', however your product has the advantage of 'looking 
    good, really works and is realistic in price', Thanks.
